========

Twisted Python callback script for real time Facebook events.

It's a deamon that will run and dispatch events depending on what the user has subscribed to.
For example when a user likes a "thing" on Facebook this script is called with the details of
what it is that they liked and then the dispatch methods can deal with that as you please.
